## Task 1: Number Guessing Game

**Description:** In this task, I created a Java program for a Number Guessing Game. The user has to guess a randomly generated number within a given range. The game provides feedback on whether the guess is too high or too low until the correct number is guessed.

**Code:** You can find the code for the Number Guessing Game in the [`NumberGuessingGame`](/NumberGuessingGame) folder. It includes the Java source code, and any necessary resources or documentation.

## Task 2: ATM Interface

**Description:** For Task 2, I developed an ATM Interface program in Java. The program simulates an ATM, allowing users to perform basic banking operations like withdrawing, depositing, and checking their balance. It includes a user-friendly interface for interaction.

**Code:** The ATM Interface code can be found in the [`ATMInterface`](/ATMInterface) folder. This folder contains the Java source code, along with any related files and documentation.

Please feel free to explore each task's respective folder for more details and instructions on running the programs. If you have any questions or feedback, don't hesitate to reach out.
